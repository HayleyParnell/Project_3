# Project Overview
Working with data from the Terra and Aqua satellites that compose two thirds of NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS), we are exploring the relationship between geography and fire intensity since 2022.  Studying the relationships between fire and location over time – understanding where they take place most frequently – provides us the ability to make a more informed decision about what mitigation efforts may be needed to help minimize risk based on locale.
# How to Use
# Ethical Considerations 
Because the information discussed is based on light and radiation measurement of geophysical phenomena rather than information about individuals, there is little concern about the consent of those whose data is gathered. The primary ethical consideration would be any action taken to distribute resources based on the findings. Providing emergency resources selectively can leave those in need without valuable assistance, so any action taken as a result of this analysis should thoroughly evaluate potential harm caused by inaction in specific locales
